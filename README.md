### An LED strip controller for ESP8266 boards

#### About

I have been wanting to playing with the various LED strips available, and finally settled on the WS8213 based ones that are now common.  I want to be able to control them remotely, from a central application and/or website, to change the brightness, colours, apply effects, etc.
